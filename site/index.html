        <strong>Anything you had to change or assume about this task to make your solution</strong>
        <p>Data Emitter : Will emit the latest data received. Anyone listening to 'data-receive' event will get the latest data.</p>
        <p>Table Module:  This will initialize and manage data emitter and html renderer.This will get the data from Data emitter and will parse it to html renderer.</p>
        <p>HTML renderer: This will be initialized by table module. It will get data from table module and render results to UI.</p>
    
    </li>

        <strong>A high level description of your approach</strong>
        <p>All the dependencies of table module have been injected to it while initializing. </p>
        <p>Observable design pattern is being used to emit the data received by data emitter.</p>
        <p>
            I have tried to follow the component based architecture approach using vanilla js.
            The solution consist of Forex class which uses the CurrencyPair class for each row.
            The Forex returns the new string template to be drawn as html each time the data is updated.

        <strong>If you added any other development-time steps, what they are, why you added them and how to run
            them</strong>
        <p>
            Added mocha and set up the unit testing. I have added unit test for one module. please run <strong>npm test</strong> to run
            the tests. It will also show the test coverage.
        </p>

        <strong>Which libraries/fralivemeworks you would have liked to have used (if any), and how they would have
            made
            the result better</strong>
        <p>
            I would have liked to use react to solve this problem. The reason behind is the performance as it relies
            on virtual
            dom to update the dom and takes care about the which part is needed to be updated and just change that
            only.
            Since in this problem, we need to update the dom every second to update the data, react would have been
            a useful library.
            Also, the component based architecture also would have worked well creating different components for
            table, table-row and each sprkline.
        </p>
        <strong>Redux/Flux</strong>, will be a good choice in this case, which is designed for managing application state.
